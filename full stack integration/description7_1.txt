This project demonstrates how to connect a React frontend application to an Express.js backend using Axios. By building a simple product listing page, 
youâ€™ll learn how to fetch data from an API, manage application state, and render dynamic UI components. 
This is a foundational skill for building modern full-stack web applications.

 Key Points
Set up a basic Express.js API that returns a list of products.

Use Axios in React to fetch data from the API when the component mounts.

Implement loading and error handling states for better user experience.

Display product data dynamically in a responsive card layout.

Run both frontend and backend locally to test real-time API integration.

 Learning Outcomes
Understand how to connect frontend and backend using REST APIs.

Gain hands-on experience in data fetching with Axios in React.

Learn to manage asynchronous operations and handle responses.

Improve skills in state management and UI rendering.

Build confidence to integrate APIs in future full-stack applications.
