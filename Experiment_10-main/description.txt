Build a React app (e.g., using Create React App).

Write a multi-stage Dockerfile: Stage 1 uses Node.js to install dependencies and build the app; Stage 2 uses Nginx to serve static files.

Add a .dockerignore file to exclude unnecessary files like node_modules, build, and .git.

Build the Docker image locally and run it to test the React app on http://localhost
.

Verify the final Docker image is smaller and only includes necessary files.

Deploy backend and frontend on separate AWS EC2 instances.

Set up an Application Load Balancer (ALB) to distribute traffic across multiple backend instances.

Configure security groups, VPC settings, and optionally domain routing via Route 53.

Test deployment to ensure the app is accessible online and load balancer handles traffic correctly.

Create a GitHub Actions workflow (.github/workflows/main.yml) to automate testing and deployment.

Configure the workflow to trigger on every push to the main branch, set up Node.js, install dependencies, run tests, and build the project.

Optionally, configure the workflow to deploy build artifacts to GitHub Pages, Netlify, or S3.

Commit and push changes to verify that the workflow runs successfully.

Ensure automated testing, build, and optional deployment run on every push, with visible workflow status in the repository.
